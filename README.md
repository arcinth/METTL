# Java Number Logic & Mettl Practice Programs

This repository contains a collection of **Java programs** created to practice and master **number-based logic questions** commonly asked in **Mettl, TCS, Accenture, Wipro, Zoho, and other placement exams**.

These problems focus on:
- Digits manipulation
- Prime numbers
- Fibonacci
- Counting logic
- Mathematical reasoning

All programs are written in **Java (JDK 7 compatible)** with clear logic and without using advanced libraries.

## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository

This repository is built to:
- Strengthen **logical thinking**
- Prepare for **Mettl and coding aptitude tests**
- Improve **Java problem-solving skills**
- Practice **loops, conditions, and number operations**

These programs are designed without shortcuts so that the **core logic is clearly understood**.
